# QuantumBotUpdoot

Takes 0.3 QuantumBot source and (attempts) to automatically upgrade it to 0.4.

**BEFORE STARTING BACK UP DATA**

This may not perfectly transform your scripts, and may cause irreparable damage to
your source. Backing up your source before running this is the best course of action.

To run, just pass in the folder of your source code as the first argument, like:

```
java -jar updoot.jar "/home/person/workspace/MyScripts/"
```
